# K-means Clustering
## What is the project?
This is a lab that you will implement a K-means algorithm and use it for image compression. You will gain the intuition of K-Mean algorithm by using a sample dataset first. Then you can get a further understanding by compressing the image.

## Concepts
### K-means Clustering
K-means clustering is a method for grouping n observations into K clusters. It uses vector quantization and aims to assign each observation to the cluster with the nearest mean or centroid, which serves as a prototype for the cluster. The K-means algorithm is a method to automatically cluster similar data points together.

## Which programing language and packages did I use?
### Language
Python - It is a high-level, general-purpose language. It has concise and expressive syntax, as well as a powerful standard library. It is suitable for various application development domains, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more. In this procject, I used python to accomplish some mechine learning work.

### Packages
numpy - It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

matplotlib - It is a popular library to plot graphs in Python.

```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Dataset
In this lab, I will use a list data and an image.
